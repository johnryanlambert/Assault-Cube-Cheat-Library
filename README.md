## Assault Cube EZ Mode Injector
An internal DLL injector written in C++. It leverages Windows APIs to force the Assault Cube process to load a malicious DLL. An easy to use GUI is provided using the Qt framework.

## Cheat Suite
A collection of cheats for Assault Cube. When successfully injected, an in-game head-up display rendered using OpenGL to display activation state of the cheats. Wallhacks work by using OpenGL to render a box around enemy players that is always visibile to the user. The triggerbot uses a separate activation keybinding for stealth purposes. This allows the user to leverage the triggerbot functionality in quick bursts on-demand. The following cheats are available via the corresponding keybinds:

- F1: Invincibility
- F2: Max Ammo
- F3: No Recoil
- F4: Speed Boost
- F5: Wallhack (esp)
- F6: Triggerbot ON/OFF
- CapsLock: Activate triggerbot

*Note: Due to certain data being managed server side, not all exploits will work in online multiplayer.
